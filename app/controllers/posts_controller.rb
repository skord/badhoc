  # Yeah, there's a lot of caching methods here, its much of an attempt to cover different cases.
  # Because of CSRF protection and user sessions, the response headers really only do anything
  # at all if you're stripping cookies at the reverse proxy session. If you setup that way,
  # I'd recommend a filter to avoid the /admin path and other admin actions you can find in 
  # rake routes. See, isn't RESTfulness super? TL;DR: Cache headers mean nothing unless you've 
  # configured your reverse proxy to toss cookies. 
  #
  # There is a conditional get for index, which will throw a 304 unless the 
  # content in the block and the last modified date has changed.
  #
  # The action caching on the show method is a lot faster than fragment caching or even the 
  # conditional get. Does not work for the index action because of pagination. Uses more memcached
  # space, but its worth it. It bypasses doing the db query at all, hence faster. If you're limited
  # to a small memcached instance, it might be better to modify this so the action caching is turned 
  # off but keep the conditional get. The conditional get is in place as well as the action caching 
  # for the case where the cache is expired or not available. 
  #
  # In the views there are quite a bit of partial fragments cached. The render times for comments 
  # and post names, emails etc are a bit high and there are quite a few of these.

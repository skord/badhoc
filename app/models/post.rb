  # It used to be that the post threshold was the entire site. That's fixed as of this commit. 
  # Active post threshold is now per board, hence lowering the number by a factor of 10 here. 
  # Still a small issue though, this needs to be moved to the board model for post aging somehow, 
  # but you end up screwing up the named scopes below. So for now the active threshold for posts
  # is still a global (across every board) value. This is reflected in the weird mix of instance
  # and singleton methods at the bottom until I get that mentally cleared up.

  # Since the post controller makes use of the 'active' scope, posts
  # that have aged off won't appear in the app, but the assets can 
  # still be linked to, which can be a problem if you do third party
  # hosting via S3 or rackspace or something.

  # There's three scenarios here:
  # 1. Extremely low traffic sites. Pick #1. 
  # 2. Your dorm room, pick the #2.
  # 3. High traffic sites. Pick number one, but by all means get a
  # hold of me so this can be done better.

  # So, pick one of the following:

  # #1: No auto-cleanup. Periodically run Post.cleanup! somehow.

  # #2: Auto-Cleanup, non-async. You have been warned.

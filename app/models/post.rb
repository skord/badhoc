  # It used to be that the post threshold was the entire site. That's fixed as of this commit. 
  # Active post threshold is now per board, hence lowering the number by a factor of 10 here. 
  # Still a small issue though, this needs to be moved to the board model for post aging somehow, 
  # but you end up screwing up the named scopes below. So for now the active threshold for posts
  # is still a global (across every board) value. This is reflected in the weird mix of instance
  # and singleton methods at the bottom until I get that mentally cleared up.

  # Hey awesome, you're running the delayed_job branch for asynchronous awesomness!

  # Rather than looking over there, I'll just mention here that it throws a destroy
  # job in queue for each Post that's expired (not a destroy_all, the AREL stuff doesn't
  # work as expected, maybe I'm wrong). Some of of those are doomed to fail since I'm 
  # not deduplicating or throwing up a flag for "put in the kill me queue", but it's
  # no big deal.

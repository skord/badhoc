class Post < ActiveRecord::Base

  # The active post threshold is site wide, which effects the contents of the positions
  # per-board. this is why I've pulled the post "rank" (position) as of this commit,
  # as it can be confusing to see a board with no posts ranked #1. It's actually sort of 
  # confusing to think about too, but a change in the positions in one board will just 
  # shift the positions in the other without changing their order. 
  # 
  # Why this way? Because the picwall also sorts by position, but it ignores any sort
  # of board order. 
  #
  # So if you have one insanely popular board, yes, content will expire on less popular 
  # boards sooner, but then again, you probably have other problems if that's the case.
